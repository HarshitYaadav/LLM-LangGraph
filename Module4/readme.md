Module 4

Video 1 – Parallelization
Learned about executing multiple nodes simultaneously and merging their results, as well as the use of reducers and custom reducers for managing parallel updates.

Video 2 – Sub Graph
Learned that sub graphs enable modular state management for multi-agent workflows in LangGraph, improving organization and scalability.

Video 3 – Map Reduce
Learned that map reduce allows efficient parallelization and aggregation of tasks in LangGraph workflows, optimizing processing across multiple nodes.

Video 4 – Research Assistant
Learned that multi-agent research assistants in LangGraph can coordinate tasks such as analysis, interviews, and report generation through structured graph workflows, enabling collaborative and automated research processes.
